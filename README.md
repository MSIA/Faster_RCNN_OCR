# Faster_RCNN_OCR
FCN Faster_RCNN + OCR
# Noticeï¼š
This PyTorch implementation currently supports text detection by Faster-RCNN and OCR by CRNN in two seperate models.

## Installation:
Please refer to [ruotianluo's Faster-RCNN implementation](https://github.com/ruotianluo/pytorch-faster-rcnn#installation), and [meijieru's CRNN implementation](https://github.com/meijieru/crnn.pytorch). [Baidu's Warp-ctc](https://github.com/baidu-research/warp-ctc) is also relied for the translation.

## Performance:
TBA
